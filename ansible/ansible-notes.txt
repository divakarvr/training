Why Ansible? 
* To maintain or carry out post provision activities on the server(s)
    - why userdata is not enough? 
      * User data is good when provisining the instance. But what about the maintanence after the machine has been provisioned? 
      * This can be overcome by using Configuration management tools

* what are configuration mgmt tools?
    ~ They are the ones which can carry out installations, configuration of tools/software inside the server

* what are the popular configuration management tools?
    ~ Puppet
    ~ Chef 
    ~ Ansible

* Why are we going with Ansible? 
    * Jenkins (not related. just to show you the advantage)
        Jenkins master 
            * A process runs all the time (takes up resources in the system)
            ---> node
                * java process will keep running iin the node which communicates with the master more often
      Problem: You have a tool which consumes resources in the system to give you something.
    * Similar to Jenkins, Puppet and chef are having the master-slave mechanism 
    * Ansible:
        - Doesnt have any daemon processes running
        - works with linux and windows
        - when working with linux, purely uses ssh communication
        - when working with windows, purely uses powershell
    * Ansible runs on Python with Linux machines. Coming to windows, its powershell
        * Chef, Puppet runs overy Ruby
        * Ansible is faster because its using Python underlying
